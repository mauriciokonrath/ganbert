TOXIC:toxic	Memo re Roundup NNG exposure in laboratory
TOXIC:toxic	Study on glyphosate: plasma and bone marrow.
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains a Monsanto-led study testing N-ntirosoglyphosate (“NNG”) on mice. Before getting a pass from the EPA, Monsanto conducted this one long-term carcinogenicity test of NNG in mice. The testing was conducted outside of IBT laboratories (which Monsanto had used for NNG testing until it was shut down due to fraud). This study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in malignant lymphomas in male mice. No evidence suggests this study was ever submitted to EPA.
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains an EPA paper entitled, ‘Guidance for the Reregistration of Pesticide Products Containing Glyphosate as the Active Ingredient’. The EPA initially required that Monsanto test for the carcinogenicity of NNG in the 1970s and early 1980s. The testing for NNG by Monsanto was mainly conducted by IBT laboratories which was shut down in the 1970s due to fraud. The EPA determined that these NNG studies were not acceptable to show that NNG was not mutagenic. The EPA, however, did not require additional testing on NNG provided that Monsanto keep the levels of NNG below 1 ppm.

TOXIC:toxic	MONGLY00978278 contains email correspondence between Monsanto employees Lisa Drake, Donna Farmer, William Heydens and others regarding Glyphosate Annex review- mutagenicity, wherein a Monsanto employee wrote: “We should avoid ‘casting any shadows’ on Roundup, particularly in countries where we have already promoted the safety/environmental superiority of our existing formulations.”
TOXIC:toxic	In 1999, Monsanto hired Dr. James M. Parry, professor at the University of Wales, to conduct an internal (and secret) safety review of glyphosate and the formulated product. In the beginning of the report, Dr. Parry identified as the first deficiency in the data: “No adequate in vitro clastogenicity data available for glyphosate formulations.” He, thus, recommends that Monsanto “provide comprehensive in vitro cytogenetic data on glyphosate formulations.” He also concludes, “My overall view is that if the reported genotoxicity of glyphosate and glyphosate formulations can be shown to be due to the production of oxidative damage then a case could be made that any genetic damage would be thresholded…it may be necessary to consider the possibility of susceptible groups within the human population.”
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains email correspondence between Monsanto employees regarding Roundup mutagenicity wherein Farmer says she “will not support doing any studies on glyphosate, formulations or other surfactant ingredients at this time….”
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains email correspondence between several Monsanto colleagues discussing the fallout from Dr. James Parry’s report on glyphosate (MONGLY01314233). Donna Farmer (Monsanto Toxicologist) writes: “right now the only person I think that can dig us out of this "genotox hole" is the Good Dr. Kier…I am concerned about leaving Perry [sp] out there with this as the final project/his final impressions…” 9/2/1999 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 MONGLY00878115 9/6/1999 Stephen Wratten (Monsanto) asks whether Dr. Parry “ever worked with industry on this sort of project?” Later, Wratten intones that the Parry report is not useful for Monsanto: “I do not see that he has stuck his neck out on anything at all controversial, and therefore, there is little value in the write-up as written that could be useful. Hope it didn't cost much…”

TOXIC:toxic	In this document, Monsanto executive William Heydens expresses concern over Dr. James Parry’s request to evaluate Propachlor, an herbicide that Monsanto holds the patent to. Mark Martens writes that one of the advantages of letting Parry test Propachlor is that will “keep prof Parry happy which will make him a good proponent of glyphosate.” Heydens disagrees: “Please don't do anything until we discuss this. Data generated by academics has always been a major concern for us in the defense of our products.”
TOXIC:toxic	The document contains email correspondence between Donna Farmer (Monsanto Toxicologist) and Daniel Goldstein. Farmer includes a previous correspondence in which William (Bill) Graham tells colleagues: “One of the problems with email - everyone can start running around looking for solutions. Can we keep this to a limited number of people as we have the opinions and the solutions in Europe.” The email also references Mark Martens’ work with Dr. James Parry, a highly respected expert in genotoxicity. According to Farmer: “Mark was not managing that well and that almost landed us with Parry calling glyphosate genotoxic....so we had to do these additional studies to make him happy and if it had not been for Larry Kier we would be in dog.......”

However, it will not be picked up by most of the usual suspects because it's not mentioned in the abstract.”
TOXIC:toxic	Donna Farmer’s 1/11/2017 deposition details Monsanto’s reaction to Dr. James Parry’s review of glyphosate. Specifically, the deposition covers Monsanto’s reluctance to conduct studies suggested by Dr. Parry after being unhappy with Parry’s conclusions. Likewise, it appears that Monsanto never submitted Dr. Parry’s work on glyphosate to the EPA, even though internal emails describe him as a renowned expert. 12/6/2001 Documents Released: 3/1/2019 N/A 1/11/2017 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 Farmer is also asked about dermal absorption of glyphosate, and the effect of the surfactant in making glyphosate more able to get into the skin.
TOXIC:toxic	This document is an email correspondence between Drs. William Heydens and Donna Farmer, wherein the two discuss various studies which observed adverse effects by the formulated Roundup product. Specifically, Dr. Farmer acknowledges: “[t]he interest point is glyphosate all basicially [sic] had no effect the formulated product did - does this point us to the coformulants - sufactants? [sic]” at *2. Dr. Heydens also admits, after discussing with Monsanto consultant John DeSesso, that “we are in pretty good shape with glyphosate but vulnerable with surfactants. . . What I’ve been hearing from you is that this continues to be the case with these studies - Glyphosate is OK but the formulated product (and thus the surfactant) does the damage.” at *1. In MONGLY00885527, Heydens and Farmer discuss the European Commission’s request for endocrine disruptor information from plant protection product (PPP) manufacturers and how the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) and its sub-group European Crop Protection Association (ECPA) plotted to provide no information. Heydens on “free studies”: “I want to understand what they all say, and see if there is anything more we should be doing besides the usual ‘pay no attention to the man behind the curtain’… Even though no testing requirements have been implemented for several years now, this damn endocrine crap just doesn't go away, does it.”

Acquavella’s preliminary calculations reveal that in most cases the AHS significantly overestimates exposure.”
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains correspondence between Michael Cunningham (Monsanto) and several other colleagues discussing a counter argument against N-ntirosoglyphosate (“NNG”). The email quotes Dr. Ruth Shearer in 1984: "The problem with glyphosate... is that it combines readily with nitrites, found in normal human saliva, to form an N-nitroso compound called N-nitrosoglyphosate. Although that particular compound has not been tested as a cancer-causing agent, over 75% of all other N-nitroso compounds so tested have been shown to cause cancer by way of tumour formation." 9/23/2004 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 NNG is found in glyphosate-based formulations such as Roundup, but not necessarily in glyphosate evaluated in animal bioassays. The public will not find any reference to NNG on the Roundup® label. NNG is part of a family of carcinogenic chemicals known as “nitroso compounds”. Nitroso compounds have consistently been identified as carcinogenic following analysis. NNG forms whenever glyphosate interacts with nitrites, whether outside or inside the body.

GHOST:ghost	In these documents, Monsanto scientist David Saltmiras admits to writing manuscript of glyphosate genotoxicity literature with Larry Kier, a Monsanto consultant (MONGLY02145925). The email correspondence also details how adding scientist David Kirkland to the study would “add credibility.” (MONGLY02145918) “Adding David Kirkland as a co-author to both review papers would add £14,000 (pounds Stirling) to the project, which split by 25 seems a fair investment,” writes Christophe Gustin (Monsanto EU) in a discussion about possible co-authors for glyphosate genotoxicity literature. David Saltmiras writes that adding Kirkland’s expertise to the genotoxicity manuscript “comes at a premium”: “David Kirkland believes his efforts will be less than 10 days at £1,400/day (equivalent to $21,780 with the current exchange rate), so we are effectively doubling the cost of the combined projects, but reaping significant value/credibility from David Kirkland's involvement.

CHEMI:chemi	October 1995 Roundup Material Safety Data Sheet
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains a paper written by Mark Martens, Christophe Gustin and C. Bates on how the surfactants in Roundup formulations increase the absorption of glyphosate in the human skin. The paper includes the following passage: “Surfactants are able to increase glyphosate absorption through the skin by (1) removal of lipids (sebum) from the epidermal surface due to surfactant action, (2) increase of the hydration state of the skin (under closed exposure conditions), (3) increase of skin contact (spreading of water droplets by surfactant action), (4) increase of contact time with the skin due to decrease of evaporation of water from the droplets containing surfactant (surfactant monolayer at surface of droplets slows down passage to vapour phase,) increase of sub epidermal blood flow due to irritant action of surfactant, (6) intraepidermal and sub epidermal intercellular water accumulation due to the irritant action of the surfactant.”
CHEMI:chemi	The first document (MONGLY06653096) contains email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel regarding “dermal penetration studies” wherein Dr. William Heydens notes the presence of “certain co-formulants like humectants that will make it highly likely we will get large amounts penetrating the skin.” at *1. The second document (MONGLY01832749) contains acknowledgments by Dr. Daniel Goldstein that a humectant such as ethylene glycol (which is present in most Roundup formulations) is toxic to children at 70 cc of Roundup with 5% of ethylene glycol. at *1. The third document (MONGLY01745304) is a fact sheet about ethylene glycol which indicates its presence in Roundup formulations (“less than 2%”) and that “EG is a significant human toxin”. at *1.

CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. William Heydens observes with respect to two Monsanto rat studies: “Regarding acute toxicity, Terry, Donna and I reviewed mortality data from the inhalation database for IPA, NH4-, MEA and K-glyphosate formulations. Based on the mortality data seen in those studies, it is not outside the realm of possibilities that the 3 deaths were treatment – related.” at *2.
CHEMI:chemi	The first document (MONGLY06424476) contains email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel regarding a 2002 Monsanto study which observed absorption of the surfactant (without glyphosate) in the GI Tract. Dr. Charles Healy (Monsanto) reports that the results showed “Absorption was at least 56% of dose at dosages of 1 and 10 mg/kg. Approximately 17-27% of the dose was eliminated in the urine and approximately 31-36% of the dose was found in the bile.” at *2 The second document (MONGLY06409924) contains further discussion of this issue, stating that Monsanto’s purpose for conducting the study, which was “to see results which show no GI tract absorption of a surfactant in the tallow/ether amine groups.” MONGLY06409924 at *1. Indeed, Dr. Healy states in MONGLY06424476 that: “Basically what we demonstrated was that the material is absorbed through the GI tract as shown. Nothing I am aware of that needs to be reported. We were hoping that we could demonstrate that the material was not absorbed as a means to obviate the need to perform toxicity testing with similar inert ingredients. Obviously that hope was not realized.” at *2.

CHEMI:chemi	These documents contain email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel wherein Richard Garnett discusses the issue of acute toxicity via inhalation. Mr. Garnett states that glyphosate would be classified in the EU as “T Toxic; R23 Toxic by inhalation” based on a study he cites. at *1. The attachment is Monsanto Study “An Acute Nose-Only Inhalation Toxicity Study in Rats with Mon 78623”. This study is one of the studies referenced by Dr. Heydens in the previous (MONGLY06722561) document to conclude that “it is not outside the realm of possibilities that the 3 deaths were treatment-related.” MONGLY0672256 at *2.
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between Richard Garnett, David Saltmiras, Donna Farmer and other Monsanto employees discussing glyphosate ADME. Garnett writes that Monsanto “needs solid data for ADME arising from dermal exposure.” He continues: 11/10/2008 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 “The movement of glyphosate in the blood flow from dermal contact, is different to that through oral or intravenous exposure. The little data we have suggests that the excretion is significantly more through the faeces than the urine…Dermal exposure is the greatest risk of exposure for operators. Therefore, we need to be secure on the ADME of such exposure.” Unfortunately, despite Garnett’s recommendation, Monsanto declined to do additional testing on dermal absorption because the potential of finding a new glyphosate metabolite was “too risky.” The issue of whether glyphosate is excreted through the urine rather than feces is important because Monsanto only considers urine levels of glyphosate in an effort to underestimate glyphosate exposure and does not measure levels in feces. In their depositions, David Saltmiras and Donna Farmer both deny that dermally absorbed glyphosate is excreted through the feces.
CHEMI:chemi	Monsanto Spain employee admits that “a higher penetration could happen in the presence of tallow amine or other surfactants.”
CHEMI:chemi	Emails discussion re absorption wherein it is stated that “glyphosate rat ADME study also shows that levels in bone are significantly higher than those in any other tissue/organ.”
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between Maurice De Billot (Monsanto) and Christophe Gustin, wherein Mr. De Billot discusses the difficulties of dermal absorption using the UK POEM (The UK Predictive Operator Exposure Model) metric: “In Europe we are getting prepared to submit MON 79991 (720g/kg) for approval under the new Reg 1107/2009. We ran the UKPOEM model using a dermal penetration value of 3% and do not pass when applying 3.6kg/ha for the tractor mounted sprayer. I am aware of the set of studies that you ran on dermal absorption using pure K-salt and IPA-salt and also MON 52276 and MON 79351 which showed dermal absorption values of 1%. Putting 1% in the model we get a good result, so will need to show that the 1% dermal absorption numbers are equally valid for the MON 79991 formulation.” at *2.

CHEMI:chemi	This document contains a segment of David Saltmiras’ deposition. The questioning centers on dermal absorption and excretion of Roundup. Saltmiras did not appear to have all the data: 1/31/2017 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 Plaintiffs Counsel: [Y]ou're aware that it's more appropriate to measure -- the excretion [of glyphosate] is significantly more in the feces than in the urine for dermal absorption of Roundup, right? Saltmiras: There is no scientific basis for saying that glyphosate absorbed through the skin is found in the feces. That's utter nonsense. I don't know where you're coming up with this.

REGUL:regul	This series of documents contains back and forth with EPA, Monsanto, some SAP and expert summaries regarding whether or not a new mouse study was required due to the renal tumor findings in the repeat study done after the IBT scandal. These are discussions after deciding to include the magic tumor and Monsanto was asserting that the historical range in controls was 0-7.1% and the K&H 6.6% in the high dose was within that range, plus the 30,000mg was too high above MTD. Monsanto falsely asserted to EPA that the historical range was 0-7.1% when the max was actually 4.7%. EPA called them out for it, as well as for their asserting a couple of inapplicable studies. The K&H 6.6% was greater than the historical range of 4.7%. Notwithstanding, EPA decided not to require the additional mouse study, an ongoing rat study would be enough.
