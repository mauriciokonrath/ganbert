GHOST:ghost	In these documents, Monsanto scientist David Saltmiras admits to writing manuscript of glyphosate genotoxicity literature with Larry Kier, a Monsanto consultant (MONGLY02145925). The email correspondence also details how adding scientist David Kirkland to the study would “add credibility.” (MONGLY02145918) “Adding David Kirkland as a co-author to both review papers would add £14,000 (pounds Stirling) to the project, which split by 25 seems a fair investment,” writes Christophe Gustin(Monsanto EU) in a discussion about possible co-authors for glyphosate genotoxicity literature.David Saltmiras writes that adding Kirkland’s expertise to the genotoxicity manuscript “comes ata premium”: “David Kirkland believes his efforts will be less than 10 days at £1,400/day(equivalent to $21,780 with the current exchange rate), so we are effectively doubling the cost ofthe combined projects, but reaping significant value/credibility from David Kirkland'sinvolvement. Given the growing number of questionable genotoxicity publications, in my mindthis is worth the addition cost.”

GHOST:ghost	This document contains a series of email exchanges between various Monsanto personnel regarding letters to the editor of Food and Chemical Toxicology seeking retraction of a study by Professor G.E. Seralini. Mr. Eric Sachs writes about his efforts to galvanize scientists in a letter- writing campaign in order to retract the article: “I talked to Bruce Chassy and he will send his letter to Wally Hayes directly and notify other scientists that have sent letters to do the same. He understands the urgency...I remain adamant that Monsanto must: not be put: in the position ofproviding the critical analysis that leads the editors to retract the paper.” at *3, 2; see alsoMONGLY01045298 (below).
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains a Monsanto-led study testing N-ntirosoglyphosate (“NNG”) on mice. Before getting a pass from the EPA, Monsanto conducted this one long-term carcinogenicity test of NNG in mice. The testing was conducted outside of IBT laboratories (which Monsanto hadused for NNG testing until it was shut down due to fraud). This study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in malignant lymphomas in male mice. No evidence suggests this study wasever submitted to EPA.
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains an EPA paper entitled, ‘Guidance for the Reregistration of Pesticide Products Containing Glyphosate as the Active Ingredient’. The EPA initially required that Monsanto test for the carcinogencity of NNG in the 1970s and early 1980s. The testing for NNG by Monsanto was mainly conducted by IBT laboratories which was shut down in the 1970s due to fraud. The EPA determined that these NNG studies were not acceptable to show that NNG wasnot mutagenic. The EPA, however, did not require additional testing on NNG provided that Monsanto keep the levels of NNG below 1 ppm.
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains email exchanges between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. Donna Farmer summarizes the findings of Monsanto’s expert, Dr. James Parry: “Dr. Parry concluded on his evaluation of the four articles that glyphosate is capable of producing genotoxicity both in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism based upon the production of oxidative damage.” at *3.
TOXIC:toxic	This document, from 1999, contains email correspondence from between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. Donna Farmer writes: “I will not support doing any studies on glyphosate, formulations or other surfactant ingredients at this time with the limited information we have on the situation.” at *2.
TOXIC:toxic	In 1999, Monsanto hired Dr. James M. Parry, professor at the University of Wales, to conduct an internal (and secret) safety review of glyphosate and the formulated product. In the beginning of the report, Dr. Parry identified as the first deficiency in the data: “No adequate in vitro clastogenicity data available for glyphosate formulations.” He, thus, recommends that Monsanto “provide comprehensive in vitro cytogenetic data on glyphosate formulations.” He also concludes, “My overall view is that if the reported genotoxicity of glyphosate and glyphosate formulations can be shown to be due to the production of oxidative damage then a case could be made that anygenetic damage would be thesholded...it may be necessary to consider the possibility ofsusceptible groups within the human population.”
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains email correspondence between several Monsanto colleagues discussing the fallout from Dr. James Parry’s report on glyphosate (MONGLY01314233). Donna Farmer (Monsanto Toxicologist) writes: “right now the only person I think that can dig us out of this "genotox hole" is the Good Dr. Kier...I am concerned about leaving Perry [sp] out there with thisas the final project/his final impressions...” Stephen Wratten (Monsanto) asks whether Dr. Parry “ever worked with industry on this sort ofproject?” Later, Wratten intones that the Parry report is not useful for Monsanto: “I do not see thathe has stuck his neck out on anything at all controversial, and therefore, there is little value in thewrite-up as written that could be useful. Hope it didn't cost much...”
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains an email from William Heydens to Monsanto colleagues after reading the Parry report on glyphosate. In his correspondence, Heydens writes after reading the report: "We want to find/develop someone who is comfortable with the genetox profile of glyphosate/Roundup and who can be influential with regulators and Scientific Outreach operations when genetox issues arise. My read is that Parry is not currently such a person, and it would take quite some time and $$$/studies to get him there. We simply aren't going to do thestudies Parry suggests.
TOXIC:toxic	This document contains email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel wherein it is stated with respect to Roundup surfactants: “While the tallow amine was considered toxic at 62.5 and 15.6 ug/ml, the C12 alkyl sulfate didn’t exhibit toxicity at any of the test doses.

CHEMI:chemi	This document contains a paper written by Mark Martens, Christophe Gustin and C. Bates on how the surfactants in Roundup formulations increase the absorption of glyphosate in the human skin. The paper includes the following passage: “Surfactants are able to increase glyphosate absorption through the skin by (1) removal of lipids(sebum) from the epidermal surface due to surfactant action, (2) increase of the hydration state ofthe skin (under closed exposure conditions), (3) increase of skin contact (spreading of waterdroplets by surfactant action), (4) increase of contact time with the skin due to decrease ofevaporation of water from the droplets containing surfactant (surfactant monolayer at surface ofdroplets slows down passage to vapour phase,) increase of sub epidermal blood flow due toirritant action of surfactant, (6) intraepidermal and sub epidermal intercellular water accumulationdue to the irritant action of the surfactant.”
CHEMI:chemi	These documents contain email correspondence (MONGLY03738295) between various Monsanto personnel regarding a Monsanto (MONGLY00888353) study on the dermal absorption of the formulated Roundup product as precipitated by the surfactant (“TNO Study”).

CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel wherein it is discussed that the Monsanto programs, including the TNO study (MONGLY00888353, challenged above), evaluating the absorption of glyphosate and formulations (including surfactants) will be ceased “because a further study was not likely to help us meet the project objective.” at *2. Abandoning this scientific inquiry, however, “[w]e are left behind with too many questions after all this.” at *1.
CHEMI:chemi	This document is an internal Monsanto summary of the “operator exposure when spraying Roundup under UK conditions.” at *1. It provides an explanation of measuring the rate of Roundup absorption using the UK POEM (discussed in the above MONGLY04107778 document).
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between Richard Garnett, David Saltmiras, Donna Farmer and other Monsanto employees discussing glyphosate ADME. Garnett writes that Monsanto “needs solid data for ADME arising from dermal exposure.” He continues: “The movement of glyphosate in the blood flow from dermal contact, is different to that throughoral or intravenous exposure. The little data we have suggests that the excretion is significantly more through the faeces than the urine...Dermal exposure is the greatest risk of exposure for operators. Therefore, we need to be secure on the ADME of such exposure.”Unfortunately, despite Garnett’s recommendation, Monsanto declined to do additional testing ondermal absorption because the potential of finding a new glyphosate metabolite was “too risky.”The issue of whether glyphosate is excreted through the urine rather than feces is importantbecause Monsanto only considers urine levels of glyphosate in an effort to underestimateglyphosate exposure and does not measure levels in feces. In their depositions, David Saltmirasand Donna Farmer both deny that dermally absorbed glyphosate is excreted through the feces.
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between Monsanto personnel wherein Richard Garnett acknowledges that: “The ADME has always been the weak link in our argument and the Spanish response highlights that we have not got rid of the problem.” at *1.
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between Maurice De Billot (Monsanto) and Christophe Gustin, wherein Mr. De Billot discusses the difficulties of dermal absorption using the UK POEM (The UK Predictive Operator Exposure Model) metric: “In Europe we are getting prepared to submit MON 79991 (720g/kg) for approval under the new Reg 1107/2009. We ran the UKPOEM model using a dermal penetration value of 3% and do not pass when applying 3.6kg/ha for the tractor mounted sprayer. I am aware of the set of studies that you ran on dermal absorptionusing pure K-salt and IPA-salt and also MON 52276 and MON 79351 which showed dermalabsorption values of 1%. Putting 1% in the model we get a good result, so will need to show thatthe 1% dermal absorption numbers are equally valid for the MON 79991 formulation.” at *2.
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence in which dermal absorption studies are discussed. Due to pending requests from two authorities (UK and Denmark), a dermal absorption study “for high load gel” is needed. Per Monsanto EU Regulatory Affairs Specialist Sarah Dreissens: “If we use the default value we do not pass the risk assessment.”
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains a segment of David Saltmiras’ deposition. The questioning centers on dermal absorption and excretion of Roundup. Saltmiras did not appear to have all the data: Plaintiffs Counsel: [Y]ou're aware that it's more appropriate to measure -- the excretion [of glyphosate] is significantly more in the feces than in the urine for dermal absorption of Roundup,right?Saltmiras: There is no scientific basis for saying that glyphosate absorbed through the skin isfound in the feces. That's utter nonsense. I don't know where you're coming up with this.

The third document (MONGLY01745304) is a fact sheet about ethylene glycol which indicates its presence in Roundup formulations (“less than 2%”) and that “EG is a significant human toxin”. at *1.

CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. William Heydens observes with respect to two Monsanto rat studies: “Regarding acute toxicity, Terry, Donna and I reviewed mortality data from the inhalation database for IPA, NH4-, MEA and K-glyphosate formulations. Based on the mortality data seen in those studies, it is not outside the realm of possibilities that the 3 deaths were treatment – related.” at *2.
CHEMI:chemi	The first document (MONGLY06424476) contains email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel regarding a 2002 Monsanto study which observed absorption of the surfactant (without glyphosate) in the GI Tract. Dr. Charles Healy (Monsanto) reports that the results showed “Absorption was at least 56% of dose at dosages of 1 and 10 mg/kg. Approximately 17-27% of the dose was eliminated in the urine and approximately 31-36% of the dose was found in the bile.” at *2 The second document (MONGLY06409924) contains further discussion of this issue, stating that Monsanto’s purpose for conducting the study, which was “to see results which show no GI tract absorption of a surfactant in the tallow/ether amine groups.” MONGLY06409924 at *1. Indeed, Dr. Healy states in MONGLY06424476 that: “Basically what we demonstrated was that the material is absorbed through the GI tract as shown. Nothing I am aware of that needs to be reported. We were hoping that we could demonstrate that the material was not absorbed as a means to obviate the need to perform toxicity testing with similar inert ingredients. Obviously that hope was not realized.” at *2.

CHEMI:chemi	These documents contain email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel wherein Richard Garnett discusses the issue of acute toxicity via inhalation. Mr. Garnett states that glyphosate would be classified in the EU as “T Toxic; R23 Toxic by inhalation” based on a study he cites. at *1. The attachment is Monsanto Study “An Acute Nose-Only Inhalation Toxicity Study in Rats with Mon 78623”. This study is one of the studies referenced by Dr. Heydens in the previous (MONGLY06722561) document to conclude that “it is not outside the realm of possibilities that the 3 deaths were treatment-related.” MONGLY0672256 at *2.
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between Richard Garnett, David Saltmiras, Donna Farmer and other Monsanto employees discussing glyphosate ADME. Garnett writes that Monsanto “needs solid data for ADME arising from dermal exposure.” He continues: 11/10/2008 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 “The movement of glyphosate in the blood flow from dermal contact, is different to that through oral or intravenous exposure. The little data we have suggests that the excretion is significantly more through the faeces than the urine…Dermal exposure is the greatest risk of exposure for operators. Therefore, we need to be secure on the ADME of such exposure.” Unfortunately, despite Garnett’s recommendation, Monsanto declined to do additional testing on dermal absorption because the potential of finding a new glyphosate metabolite was “too risky.” The issue of whether glyphosate is excreted through the urine rather than feces is important because Monsanto only considers urine levels of glyphosate in an effort to underestimate glyphosate exposure and does not measure levels in feces. In their depositions, David Saltmiras and Donna Farmer both deny that dermally absorbed glyphosate is excreted through the feces.

CHEMI:chemi	Emails discussion re absorption wherein it is stated that “glyphosate rat ADME study also shows that levels in bone are significantly higher than those in any other tissue/organ.”
CHEMI:chemi	This document contains email correspondence between Maurice De Billot (Monsanto) and Christophe Gustin, wherein Mr. De Billot discusses the difficulties of dermal absorption using the UK POEM (The UK Predictive Operator Exposure Model) metric: “In Europe we are getting prepared to submit MON 79991 (720g/kg) for approval under the new Reg 1107/2009. We ran the UKPOEM model using a dermal penetration value of 3% and do not pass when applying 3.6kg/ha for the tractor mounted sprayer. I am aware of the set of studies that you ran on dermal absorption using pure K-salt and IPA-salt and also MON 52276 and MON 79351 which showed dermal absorption values of 1%. Putting 1% in the model we get a good result, so will need to show that the 1% dermal absorption numbers are equally valid for the MON 79991 formulation.” at *2.

CHEMI:chemi	This document contains a segment of David Saltmiras’ deposition. The questioning centers on dermal absorption and excretion of Roundup. Saltmiras did not appear to have all the data: 1/31/2017 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 Plaintiffs Counsel: [Y]ou're aware that it's more appropriate to measure -- the excretion [of glyphosate] is significantly more in the feces than in the urine for dermal absorption of Roundup, right? Saltmiras: There is no scientific basis for saying that glyphosate absorbed through the skin is found in the feces. That's utter nonsense. I don't know where you're coming up with this.
