GHOST:ghostwriting In these documents, Monsanto scientist David Saltmiras admits to writing manuscript of glyphosate genotoxicity literature with Larry Kier, a Monsanto consultant (MONGLY02145925). The email correspondence also details how adding scientist David Kirkland to the study would “add credibility.” (MONGLY02145918) “Adding David Kirkland as a co-author to both review papers would add £14,000 (pounds Stirling) to the project, which split by 25 seems a fair investment,” writes Christophe Gustin(Monsanto EU) in a discussion about possible co-authors for glyphosate genotoxicity literature.David Saltmiras writes that adding Kirkland’s expertise to the genotoxicity manuscript “comes ata premium”: “David Kirkland believes his efforts will be less than 10 days at £1,400/day(equivalent to $21,780 with the current exchange rate), so we are effectively doubling the cost ofthe combined projects, but reaping significant value/credibility from David Kirkland'sinvolvement. Given the growing number of questionable genotoxicity publications, in my mindthis is worth the addition cost.”

TOXIC:surfactants This document contains a Monsanto-led study testing N-ntirosoglyphosate (“NNG”) on mice. Before getting a pass from the EPA, Monsanto conducted this one long-term carcinogenicity test of NNG in mice. The testing was conducted outside of IBT laboratories (which Monsanto hadused for NNG testing until it was shut down due to fraud). This study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in malignant lymphomas in male mice. No evidence suggests this study wasever submitted to EPA.
TOXIC:surfactants This document contains an EPA paper entitled, ‘Guidance for the Reregistration of Pesticide Products Containing Glyphosate as the Active Ingredient’. The EPA initially required that Monsanto test for the carcinogencity of NNG in the 1970s and early 1980s. The testing for NNG by Monsanto was mainly conducted by IBT laboratories which was shut down in the 1970s due to fraud. The EPA determined that these NNG studies were not acceptable to show that NNG wasnot mutagenic. The EPA, however, did not require additional testing on NNG provided that Monsanto keep the levels of NNG below 1 ppm.
TOXIC:surfactants This document contains email exchanges between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. Donna Farmer summarizes the findings of Monsanto’s expert, Dr. James Parry: “Dr. Parry concluded on his evaluation of the four articles that glyphosate is capable of producing genotoxicity both in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism based upon the production of oxidative damage.” at *3.
TOXIC:surfactants This document, from 1999, contains email correspondence from between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. Donna Farmer writes: “I will not support doing any studies on glyphosate, formulations or other surfactant ingredients at this time with the limited information we have on the situation.” at *2.
TOXIC:surfactants In 1999, Monsanto hired Dr. James M. Parry, professor at the University of Wales, to conduct an internal (and secret) safety review of glyphosate and the formulated product. In the beginning of the report, Dr. Parry identified as the first deficiency in the data: “No adequate in vitro clastogenicity data available for glyphosate formulations.” He, thus, recommends that Monsanto “provide comprehensive in vitro cytogenetic data on glyphosate formulations.” He also concludes, “My overall view is that if the reported genotoxicity of glyphosate and glyphosate formulations can be shown to be due to the production of oxidative damage then a case could be made that anygenetic damage would be thesholded...it may be necessary to consider the possibility ofsusceptible groups within the human population.”
TOXIC:surfactants This document contains email correspondence between several Monsanto colleagues discussing the fallout from Dr. James Parry’s report on glyphosate (MONGLY01314233). Donna Farmer (Monsanto Toxicologist) writes: “right now the only person I think that can dig us out of this genotox hole is the Good Dr. Kier...I am concerned about leaving Perry [sp] out there with thisas the final project/his final impressions...” Stephen Wratten (Monsanto) asks whether Dr. Parry “ever worked with industry on this sort ofproject?” Later, Wratten intones that the Parry report is not useful for Monsanto: “I do not see thathe has stuck his neck out on anything at all controversial, and therefore, there is little value in thewrite-up as written that could be useful. Hope it didn't cost much...”
TOXIC:surfactants This document contains an email from William Heydens to Monsanto colleagues after reading the Parry report on glyphosate.

TOXIC:testing In this email correspondence, Richard Garnett (Monsanto EU), Lisa Flagg (Monsanto Global Product Quality Lead, Crop Protection) and others discuss storage testing of glyphosate. Specifically, the email comments on how long-term storage of glyphosate increases NNG levels. Bart Roose (Monsanto EU): “I would suggest we agree in writing that `bad results' of NNG due to accelerated ageing can be caused by the heat level and is therefore not representative for normalageing'.”
CHEMI:absorption This document contains a paper written by Mark Martens, Christophe Gustin and C. Bates on how the surfactants in Roundup formulations increase the absorption of glyphosate in the human skin. The paper includes the following passage: “Surfactants are able to increase glyphosate absorption through the skin by (1) removal of lipids(sebum) from the epidermal surface due to surfactant action, (2) increase of the hydration state ofthe skin (under closed exposure conditions), (3) increase of skin contact (spreading of waterdroplets by surfactant action), (4) increase of contact time with the skin due to decrease ofevaporation of water from the droplets containing surfactant (surfactant monolayer at surface ofdroplets slows down passage to vapour phase,) increase of sub epidermal blood flow due toirritant action of surfactant, (6) intraepidermal and sub epidermal intercellular water accumulationdue to the irritant action of the surfactant.”

CHEMI:absorption This document contains email correspondence between Richard Garnett, David Saltmiras, Donna Farmer and other Monsanto employees discussing glyphosate ADME. Garnett writes that Monsanto “needs solid data for ADME arising from dermal exposure.” He continues: “The movement of glyphosate in the blood flow from dermal contact, is different to that throughoral or intravenous exposure. The little data we have suggests that the excretion is significantly more through the faeces than the urine...Dermal exposure is the greatest risk of exposure for operators. Therefore, we need to be secure on the ADME of such exposure.”Unfortunately, despite Garnett’s recommendation, Monsanto declined to do additional testing ondermal absorption because the potential of finding a new glyphosate metabolite was “too risky.”The issue of whether glyphosate is excreted through the urine rather than feces is importantbecause Monsanto only considers urine levels of glyphosate in an effort to underestimateglyphosate exposure and does not measure levels in feces. In their depositions, David Saltmirasand Donna Farmer both deny that dermally absorbed glyphosate is excreted through the feces.

GHOST:peer_review	In these documents, Monsanto scientist David Saltmiras admits to writing manuscript of glyphosate genotoxicity literature with Larry Kier, a Monsanto consultant (MONGLY02145925).

David Saltmiras writes that adding Kirkland’s expertise to the genotoxicity manuscript “comes at a premium”: “David Kirkland believes his efforts will be less than 10 days at £1,400/day (equivalent to $21,780 with the current exchange rate), so we are effectively doubling the cost of the combined projects, but reaping significant value/credibility from David Kirkland's involvement.

David Saltmiras writes that adding Kirkland’s expertise to the genotoxicity manuscript “comes at a premium”: “David Kirkland believes his efforts will be less than 10 days at £1,400/day (equivalent to $21,780 with the current exchange rate), so we are effectively doubling the cost of the combined projects, but reaping significant value/credibility from David Kirkland's involvement.

TOXIC:surfactants	Memo re Roundup NNG exposure in laboratory
TOXIC:surfactants	Study on glyphosate: plasma and bone marrow.
TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains a Monsanto-led study testing N-ntirosoglyphosate (“NNG”) on mice. Before getting a pass from the EPA, Monsanto conducted this one long-term carcinogenicity test of NNG in mice. The testing was conducted outside of IBT laboratories (which Monsanto had used for NNG testing until it was shut down due to fraud). This study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in malignant lymphomas in male mice. No evidence suggests this study was ever submitted to EPA.
TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains an EPA paper entitled, ‘Guidance for the Reregistration of Pesticide Products Containing Glyphosate as the Active Ingredient’. The EPA initially required that Monsanto test for the carcinogenicity of NNG in the 1970s and early 1980s. The testing for NNG by Monsanto was mainly conducted by IBT laboratories which was shut down in the 1970s due to fraud. The EPA determined that these NNG studies were not acceptable to show that NNG was not mutagenic. The EPA, however, did not require additional testing on NNG provided that Monsanto keep the levels of NNG below 1 ppm.

TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains email exchanges between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. Donna Farmer summarizes the findings of Monsanto’s expert, Dr. James Parry: “Dr. Parry concluded on his evaluation of the four articles that glyphosate is capable of producing genotoxicity both in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism based upon the production of oxidative damage.” at *3.
TOXIC:surfactants	This document, from 1999, contains email correspondence from between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. Donna Farmer writes: “I will not support doing any studies on glyphosate, formulations or other surfactant ingredients at this time with the limited information we have on the situation.” at *2.
TOXIC:surfactants	In 1999, Monsanto hired Dr. James M. Parry, professor at the University of Wales, to conduct an internal (and secret) safety review of glyphosate and the formulated product. In the beginning of the report, Dr. Parry identified as the first deficiency in the data: “No adequate in vitro clastogenicity data available for glyphosate formulations.” He, thus, recommends that Monsanto “provide comprehensive in vitro cytogenetic data on glyphosate formulations.” He also concludes, “My overall view is that if the reported genotoxicity of glyphosate and glyphosate formulations can be shown to be due to the production of oxidative damage then a case could be made that any genetic damage would be thresholded…it may be necessary to consider the possibility of susceptible groups within the human population.”
TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains email correspondence between Monsanto employees regarding Roundup mutagenicity wherein Farmer says she “will not support doing any studies on glyphosate, formulations or other surfactant ingredients at this time….”
TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains email correspondence between several Monsanto colleagues discussing the fallout from Dr. James Parry’s report on glyphosate (MONGLY01314233). Donna Farmer (Monsanto Toxicologist) writes: “right now the only person I think that can dig us out of this "genotox hole" is the Good Dr. Kier…I am concerned about leaving Perry [sp] out there with this as the final project/his final impressions…” 9/2/1999 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 MONGLY00878115 9/6/1999 Stephen Wratten (Monsanto) asks whether Dr. Parry “ever worked with industry on this sort of project?” Later, Wratten intones that the Parry report is not useful for Monsanto: “I do not see that he has stuck his neck out on anything at all controversial, and therefore, there is little value in the write-up as written that could be useful. Hope it didn't cost much…”
TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains email correspondence between Monsanto employees Stephen Wratten, Donna Farmer, Larry Kier, William Heydens and others regarding Comments on Parry write-up wherein Martens and Wratten express disappointment with the Parry report since it did not provide “supporting information.”
TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains an email from William Heydens to Monsanto colleagues after reading the Parry report on glyphosate. In his correspondence, Heydens writes after reading the report: "We want to find/develop someone who is comfortable with the genetox profile of glyphosate/Roundup and who can be influential with regulators and Scientific Outreach operations when genetox issues arise. My read is that Parry is not currently such a person, and it would take quite some time and $$$/studies to get him there. We simply aren't going to do the studies Parry suggests.

TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains a series of email exchanges between Monsanto employees re impurities in the Roundup formulation wherein Dr. Farmer states: "I am not sure what is meant by ‘there is no issue anymore with 1.4-Dioxane’. Just because FAO removed it from the specifications does not mean issues with 1,4-Dioxane will go away.”
TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains a series of email exchanges between Monsanto employees re impurities in the Roundup formulation wherein Stephen Wratten states: “I believe we chose I ppm as the limit because of analogy with nitrosamines, rather than based on, any specific scientific consideration. Given this. it is obvious that it would be cheaper to loosen the raw material specification. thereby saving ourselves and suppliers the cost of removal.”

TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains email correspondence between various Monsanto personnel wherein Dr. Mark Martens states: “I don’t know for sure how suppliers would react - but if somebody came to me and said they wanted to test Roundup I know how I would react - with serious concern. We have to really think about doing formulations even if they are not on the market . . . glyphosate is still in there and could get caught up in some false positive finding. at *1.
TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains email correspondence between Eric Haupfear (Monsanto Director of Process Technology) and others in monitoring NNG levels of glyphosate. In 2000, Haupfear found that the levels of NNG exceeded the limit of 1 ppm due to a manufacturing defect. 2/20/2001 Documents Released: “Concentration of NNG in Glyphosate: (0.0000143 / 10.24) = 1.4 ppm!!”

TOXIC:surfactants	In this document, Monsanto executive William Heydens expresses concern over Dr. James Parry’s request to evaluate Propachlor, an herbicide that Monsanto holds the patent to. Mark Martens writes that one of the advantages of letting Parry test Propachlor is that will “keep prof Parry happy which will make him a good proponent of glyphosate.” Heydens disagrees: “Please don't do anything until we discuss this. Data generated by academics has always been a major concern for us in the defense of our products.”
TOXIC:surfactants	The document contains email correspondence between Donna Farmer (Monsanto Toxicologist) and Daniel Goldstein. Farmer includes a previous correspondence in which William (Bill) Graham tells colleagues: “One of the problems with email - everyone can start running around looking for solutions. Can we keep this to a limited number of people as we have the opinions and the solutions in Europe.” The email also references Mark Martens’ work with Dr. James Parry, a highly respected expert in genotoxicity. According to Farmer: “Mark was not managing that well and that almost landed us with Parry calling glyphosate genotoxic....so we had to do these additional studies to make him happy and if it had not been for Larry Kier we would be in dog.......”
TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains email correspondence between Monsanto employees William Heydens, Donna Farmer, and John Acquavella regarding the McDuffee paper. Acquavella wrote: “It's a good result, but not everything we wanted. The (invalid) result could be— cited as a second glyphosate/NHL "finding." However, it will not be picked up by most of the usual suspects because it's not mentioned in the abstract.”
TOXIC:surfactants	Donna Farmer’s 1/11/2017 deposition details Monsanto’s reaction to Dr. James Parry’s review of glyphosate. Specifically, the deposition covers Monsanto’s reluctance to conduct studies suggested by Dr. Parry after being unhappy with Parry’s conclusions. Likewise, it appears that Monsanto never submitted Dr. Parry’s work on glyphosate to the EPA, even though internal emails describe him as a renowned expert. 12/6/2001 Documents Released: 3/1/2019 N/A 1/11/2017 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 Farmer is also asked about dermal absorption of glyphosate, and the effect of the surfactant in making glyphosate more able to get into the skin.
TOXIC:surfactants	This document is an email correspondence between Drs. William Heydens and Donna Farmer, wherein the two discuss various studies which observed adverse effects by the formulated Roundup product. Specifically, Dr. Farmer acknowledges: “[t]he interest point is glyphosate all basicially [sic] had no effect the formulated product did - does this point us to the coformulants - sufactants? [sic]” at *2. Dr. Heydens also admits, after discussing with Monsanto consultant John DeSesso, that “we are in pretty good shape with glyphosate but vulnerable with surfactants. . . What I’ve been hearing from you is that this continues to be the case with these studies - Glyphosate is OK but the formulated product (and thus the surfactant) does the damage.” at *1. In MONGLY00885527, Heydens and Farmer discuss the European Commission’s request for endocrine disruptor information from plant protection product (PPP) manufacturers and how the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) and its sub-group European Crop Protection Association (ECPA) plotted to provide no information. Heydens on “free studies”: “I want to understand what they all say, and see if there is anything more we should be doing besides the usual ‘pay no attention to the man behind the curtain’… Even though no testing requirements have been implemented for several years now, this damn endocrine crap just doesn't go away, does it.”
TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains email correspondence between Monsanto employees William Heydens, Donna Farmer and others regarding European Commission Endocrine Disrupters developments wherein Heydens wrote: …”we are in pretty good shape with glyphosate but vulnerable—with surfactants….

For 12 years, US EPA has—based its 2 mg/kg/day US ADI on a conclusion that the 175 mg/kg/day represents both a maternal and developmental NOAEL in this study. The US is—the biggest glyphosate market in the world, and all 3 companies involved enjoy sales that are supported by this position. Monsanto has repeatedly—stated and supported that 175 m/k/d conclusion, both in the US and in other world areas, and we cannot now be a party to submitting a document that—effectively says this conclusion has been incorrect.”

Acquavella’s preliminary calculations reveal that in most cases the AHS significantly overestimates exposure.”
TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains correspondence between Michael Cunningham (Monsanto) and several other colleagues discussing a counter argument against N-ntirosoglyphosate (“NNG”). The email quotes Dr. Ruth Shearer in 1984: "The problem with glyphosate... is that it combines readily with nitrites, found in normal human saliva, to form an N-nitroso compound called N-nitrosoglyphosate. Although that particular compound has not been tested as a cancer-causing agent, over 75% of all other N-nitroso compounds so tested have been shown to cause cancer by way of tumour formation." 9/23/2004 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 NNG is found in glyphosate-based formulations such as Roundup, but not necessarily in glyphosate evaluated in animal bioassays. The public will not find any reference to NNG on the Roundup® label. NNG is part of a family of carcinogenic chemicals known as “nitroso compounds”. Nitroso compounds have consistently been identified as carcinogenic following analysis. NNG forms whenever glyphosate interacts with nitrites, whether outside or inside the body.

TOXIC:surfactants	This document contains email correspondence between John Acquavella and Donna Farmer. Donna Farmer concedes that NNG is “an impurity that arises via reaction of glyphosate with nitrosating agents during or after manufacture.” Farmer adds that Monsanto’s stance on NNG: “…as a general policy standard, regulators globally have accepted that nitrosamine impurities are unavoidable in some amine- based pesticides, and that they do not require special testing or risk assessment if the levels are at 1ppm or lower. Monsanto therefore prefers to carefully control against NNG formation rather than to engage in scientific debate around its biological activity."

TOXIC:carcinogenicity	This document contains a Monsanto-led study testing N-ntirosoglyphosate (“NNG”) on mice. Before getting a pass from the EPA, Monsanto conducted this one long-term carcinogenicity test of NNG in mice. The testing was conducted outside of IBT laboratories (which Monsanto had used for NNG testing until it was shut down due to fraud). This study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in malignant lymphomas in male mice. No evidence suggests this study was ever submitted to EPA.
TOXIC:carcinogenicity	This document contains an EPA paper entitled, ‘Guidance for the Reregistration of Pesticide Products Containing Glyphosate as the Active Ingredient’. The EPA initially required that Monsanto test for the carcinogenicity of NNG in the 1970s and early 1980s. The testing for NNG by Monsanto was mainly conducted by IBT laboratories which was shut down in the 1970s due to fraud. The EPA determined that these NNG studies were not acceptable to show that NNG was not mutagenic. The EPA, however, did not require additional testing on NNG provided that Monsanto keep the levels of NNG below 1 ppm.

TOXIC:carcinogenicity	In this document, Monsanto executive William Heydens expresses concern over Dr. James Parry’s request to evaluate Propachlor, an herbicide that Monsanto holds the patent to. Mark Martens writes that one of the advantages of letting Parry test Propachlor is that will “keep prof Parry happy which will make him a good proponent of glyphosate.” Heydens disagrees: “Please don't do anything until we discuss this. Data generated by academics has always been a major concern for us in the defense of our products.”
TOXIC:carcinogenicity	The document contains email correspondence between Donna Farmer (Monsanto Toxicologist) and Daniel Goldstein. Farmer includes a previous correspondence in which William (Bill) Graham tells colleagues: “One of the problems with email - everyone can start running around looking for solutions. Can we keep this to a limited number of people as we have the opinions and the solutions in Europe.” The email also references Mark Martens’ work with Dr. James Parry, a highly respected expert in genotoxicity. According to Farmer: “Mark was not managing that well and that almost landed us with Parry calling glyphosate genotoxic....so we had to do these additional studies to make him happy and if it had not been for Larry Kier we would be in dog.......”
TOXIC:carcinogenicity	This document contains email correspondence between Monsanto employees William Heydens, Donna Farmer, and John Acquavella regarding the McDuffee paper. Acquavella wrote: “It's a good result, but not everything we wanted. The (invalid) result could be— cited as a second glyphosate/NHL "finding." However, it will not be picked up by most of the usual suspects because it's not mentioned in the abstract.”
TOXIC:carcinogenicity	Donna Farmer’s 1/11/2017 deposition details Monsanto’s reaction to Dr. James Parry’s review of glyphosate. Specifically, the deposition covers Monsanto’s reluctance to conduct studies suggested by Dr. Parry after being unhappy with Parry’s conclusions. Likewise, it appears that Monsanto never submitted Dr. Parry’s work on glyphosate to the EPA, even though internal emails describe him as a renowned expert. 12/6/2001 Documents Released: 3/1/2019 N/A 1/11/2017 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 Farmer is also asked about dermal absorption of glyphosate, and the effect of the surfactant in making glyphosate more able to get into the skin.
TOXIC:carcinogenicity	This document is an email correspondence between Drs. William Heydens and Donna Farmer, wherein the two discuss various studies which observed adverse effects by the formulated Roundup product. Specifically, Dr. Farmer acknowledges: “[t]he interest point is glyphosate all basicially [sic] had no effect the formulated product did - does this point us to the coformulants - sufactants? [sic]” at *2. Dr. Heydens also admits, after discussing with Monsanto consultant John DeSesso, that “we are in pretty good shape with glyphosate but vulnerable with surfactants. . . What I’ve been hearing from you is that this continues to be the case with these studies - Glyphosate is OK but the formulated product (and thus the surfactant) does the damage.” at *1. In MONGLY00885527, Heydens and Farmer discuss the European Commission’s request for endocrine disruptor information from plant protection product (PPP) manufacturers and how the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) and its sub-group European Crop Protection Association (ECPA) plotted to provide no information. Heydens on “free studies”: “I want to understand what they all say, and see if there is anything more we should be doing besides the usual ‘pay no attention to the man behind the curtain’… Even though no testing requirements have been implemented for several years now, this damn endocrine crap just doesn't go away, does it.”

Acquavella’s preliminary calculations reveal that in most cases the AHS significantly overestimates exposure.”
TOXIC:carcinogenicity	This document contains correspondence between Michael Cunningham (Monsanto) and several other colleagues discussing a counter argument against N-ntirosoglyphosate (“NNG”). The email quotes Dr. Ruth Shearer in 1984: "The problem with glyphosate... is that it combines readily with nitrites, found in normal human saliva, to form an N-nitroso compound called N-nitrosoglyphosate. Although that particular compound has not been tested as a cancer-causing agent, over 75% of all other N-nitroso compounds so tested have been shown to cause cancer by way of tumour formation." 9/23/2004 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 NNG is found in glyphosate-based formulations such as Roundup, but not necessarily in glyphosate evaluated in animal bioassays. The public will not find any reference to NNG on the Roundup® label. NNG is part of a family of carcinogenic chemicals known as “nitroso compounds”. Nitroso compounds have consistently been identified as carcinogenic following analysis. NNG forms whenever glyphosate interacts with nitrites, whether outside or inside the body.

TOXIC:testing	This document contains a Monsanto-led study testing N-ntirosoglyphosate (“NNG”) on mice. Before getting a pass from the EPA, Monsanto conducted this one long-term carcinogenicity test of NNG in mice. The testing was conducted outside of IBT laboratories (which Monsanto had used for NNG testing until it was shut down due to fraud). This study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in malignant lymphomas in male mice. No evidence suggests this study was ever submitted to EPA.
TOXIC:testing	This document contains an EPA paper entitled, ‘Guidance for the Reregistration of Pesticide Products Containing Glyphosate as the Active Ingredient’. The EPA initially required that Monsanto test for the carcinogenicity of NNG in the 1970s and early 1980s. The testing for NNG by Monsanto was mainly conducted by IBT laboratories which was shut down in the 1970s due to fraud. The EPA determined that these NNG studies were not acceptable to show that NNG was not mutagenic. The EPA, however, did not require additional testing on NNG provided that Monsanto keep the levels of NNG below 1 ppm.

Although that particular compound has not been tested as a cancer-causing agent, over 75% of all other N-nitroso compounds so tested have been shown to cause cancer by way of tumour formation." 9/23/2004 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 NNG is found in glyphosate-based formulations such as Roundup, but not necessarily in glyphosate evaluated in animal bioassays. The public will not find any reference to NNG on the Roundup® label. NNG is part of a family of carcinogenic chemicals known as “nitroso compounds”. Nitroso compounds have consistently been identified as carcinogenic following analysis. NNG forms whenever glyphosate interacts with nitrites, whether outside or inside the body.

CHEMI:absorption	October 1995 Roundup Material Safety Data Sheet
CHEMI:absorption	This document contains a paper written by Mark Martens, Christophe Gustin and C. Bates on how the surfactants in Roundup formulations increase the absorption of glyphosate in the human skin. The paper includes the following passage: “Surfactants are able to increase glyphosate absorption through the skin by (1) removal of lipids (sebum) from the epidermal surface due to surfactant action, (2) increase of the hydration state of the skin (under closed exposure conditions), (3) increase of skin contact (spreading of water droplets by surfactant action), (4) increase of contact time with the skin due to decrease of evaporation of water from the droplets containing surfactant (surfactant monolayer at surface of droplets slows down passage to vapour phase,) increase of sub epidermal blood flow due to irritant action of surfactant, (6) intraepidermal and sub epidermal intercellular water accumulation due to the irritant action of the surfactant.”

Approximately 17-27% of the dose was eliminated in the urine and approximately 31-36% of the dose was found in the bile.” at *2 The second document (MONGLY06409924) contains further discussion of this issue, stating that Monsanto’s purpose for conducting the study, which was “to see results which show no GI tract absorption of a surfactant in the tallow/ether amine groups.” MONGLY06409924 at *1. Indeed, Dr. Healy states in MONGLY06424476 that: “Basically what we demonstrated was that the material is absorbed through the GI tract as shown. Nothing I am aware of that needs to be reported.

CHEMI:absorption	This document contains email correspondence between Richard Garnett, David Saltmiras, Donna Farmer and other Monsanto employees discussing glyphosate ADME. Garnett writes that Monsanto “needs solid data for ADME arising from dermal exposure.” He continues: 11/10/2008 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 “The movement of glyphosate in the blood flow from dermal contact, is different to that through oral or intravenous exposure. The little data we have suggests that the excretion is significantly more through the faeces than the urine…Dermal exposure is the greatest risk of exposure for operators. Therefore, we need to be secure on the ADME of such exposure.” Unfortunately, despite Garnett’s recommendation, Monsanto declined to do additional testing on dermal absorption because the potential of finding a new glyphosate metabolite was “too risky.” The issue of whether glyphosate is excreted through the urine rather than feces is important because Monsanto only considers urine levels of glyphosate in an effort to underestimate glyphosate exposure and does not measure levels in feces. In their depositions, David Saltmiras and Donna Farmer both deny that dermally absorbed glyphosate is excreted through the feces.

We ran the UKPOEM model using a dermal penetration value of 3% and do not pass when applying 3.6kg/ha for the tractor mounted sprayer. I am aware of the set of studies that you ran on dermal absorption using pure K-salt and IPA-salt and also MON 52276 and MON 79351 which showed dermal absorption values of 1%. Putting 1% in the model we get a good result, so will need to show that the 1% dermal absorption numbers are equally valid for the MON 79991 formulation.” at *2.

CHEMI:absorption	This document contains a segment of David Saltmiras’ deposition. The questioning centers on dermal absorption and excretion of Roundup. Saltmiras did not appear to have all the data: 1/31/2017 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 Plaintiffs Counsel: [Y]ou're aware that it's more appropriate to measure -- the excretion [of glyphosate] is significantly more in the feces than in the urine for dermal absorption of Roundup, right? Saltmiras: There is no scientific basis for saying that glyphosate absorbed through the skin is found in the feces. That's utter nonsense. I don't know where you're coming up with this.

CHEMI:metabolism	This document contains email correspondence between Richard Garnett, David Saltmiras, Donna Farmer and other Monsanto employees discussing glyphosate ADME. Garnett writes that Monsanto “needs solid data for ADME arising from dermal exposure.” He continues: 11/10/2008 Documents Released: 3/15/2017 “The movement of glyphosate in the blood flow from dermal contact, is different to that through oral or intravenous exposure. The little data we have suggests that the excretion is significantly more through the faeces than the urine…Dermal exposure is the greatest risk of exposure for operators. Therefore, we need to be secure on the ADME of such exposure.” Unfortunately, despite Garnett’s recommendation, Monsanto declined to do additional testing on dermal absorption because the potential of finding a new glyphosate metabolite was “too risky.” The issue of whether glyphosate is excreted through the urine rather than feces is important because Monsanto only considers urine levels of glyphosate in an effort to underestimate glyphosate exposure and does not measure levels in feces. In their depositions, David Saltmiras and Donna Farmer both deny that dermally absorbed glyphosate is excreted through the feces.

We do not agree with the withdrawal but we will abide. We simple would need the argumentation for the ban/withdrawal to not be based on ‘human health’ but other on considerations like precautionary principle. The consequences of this ban if referring to human health risks have the potential to go beyond France and would potentially have global and trade impact.

We simple would need the argumentation for the ban/withdrawal to not be based on ‘human health’ but other on considerations like precautionary principle. The consequences of this ban if referring to human health risks have the potential to go beyond France and would potentially have global and trade impact. It is therefore of essence that any intention to ban does not refer to imminent human health risk.” at *2.
